My name is MOmchil. I am 21 years old. My hobbies are coding(especially on C++, C# and Ruby, also likes Python but only know the basics of it), sports such as football, basketball and table tennis. I think I am pretty ambitious and hard-working person with enourmous desire to elarn new things and tricks in the programming world especially.
I chose SoftUni because I like the way things are happening there such as teaching, friendly attitude and helpful people. That's why I think it is the best place for me at the moment.
